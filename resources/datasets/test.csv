0;Bernie Sanders had a heart attack;Deanna Hackney and Caroline Kelly;"(CNN)Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders suffered a heart attack  his campaign confirmed on Friday after he departed Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas.

""I want to thank the doctors  nurses  and staff at the Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center for the excellent care that they provided "" Sanders said in a statement Friday. ""After two and a half days in the hospital  I feel great  and after taking a short time off  I look forward to getting back to work.""
Sanders' treating physicians -- Arturo Marchand Jr.  MD  and Arjun Gururaj  MD -- confirmed that the senator was diagnosed with a ""myocardial infarction"" and had two stents placed in a blocked coronary artery  noting that ""all other arteries were normal."" Myocardial infarction is the medical term for a heart attack.
They added that Sanders' hospital stay and treatment were ""uneventful with good expected progress "" and that he had been instructed ""to follow up with his personal physician.""
Sanders tweeted later Friday to thank his well-wishers for their continued support.
""Hello everybody! We're in Las Vegas. I'm feeling so much better "" he said. ""Thank you for all of the love and warm wishes that you sent me. See you soon on the campaign trail.""
In the accompanying video of Sanders saying nearly the same message a few hours after leaving the hospital  Sanders' wife  Jane  added  ""Thank you all so much. It really made a difference.""
The senator from Vermont had experienced ""chest discomfort"" at a campaign event on Tuesday night  according to senior adviser Jeff Weaver.
Weaver said on Wednesday that Sanders will be ""canceling his events and appearances until further notice."" On Thursday  his campaign confirmed that he will be taking part in the next Democratic primary debate on October 15 and that he plans to return home to Vermont in the coming days before taking part in the debate.
Jane Sanders said in a statement Thursday afternoon that her husband is ""up and about"" and has not undergone any additional procedures"" since the stent insertion.
""He's been spending the last couple of days just having a good time  talking to people  friends and family and so many well wishers that have called and his friends and then of course the well wishers that have tweeted  emailed  called  all of our phones. And we just really want to thank them "" she said.
Sanders had tweeted late Wednesday afternoon to address his health  tying it to one of his central campaign issues.

1;Alabama Requires Birth Certificate To Use Public Bathroom;Viral Cords;"Alabama is the first country to enact insane bathroom laws. You must show your birth certificate to one of thousands bathroom police in order to use the facility.

“The gender stated on your birth certificate will determine what bathroom you may use ” said Jack Offerman. “Taxpayers pay for the construction and maintenance for the bathrooms where kids might be and this is a great way to protect and teach them to obey the law no matter how absurd it is. The law is the law.”

The State will hire over 10 000 Bathroom Patrol Officers (BPO) to conduct birth certificate checks. State representatives claim it will stop drug use and excessive dancing which leads to intercourse. 

The ACLU plans to file a lawsuit for obvious racist reasons. “What if a foreigner is visiting the state of Alabama? We don’t know why anyone would but it could possibly happen ” said Charles Dickerson. “We all know this law is to ban transgender and immigrants from the state. And since they can’t use a bathroom  they will be more likely to defecate outside which penalties have also increased.”

2;Iranian Hackers Target Trump Campaign as Threats to 2020 Mount;Nicole Perlroth and David E. Sanger;"SAN FRANCISCO — The 2020 presidential election is still 13 months away  but already Iranians are following in the footsteps of Russia and have begun cyberattacks aimed at disrupting the campaigns.

Microsoft said on Friday that Iranian hackers  with apparent backing from the government  had made more than 2 700 attempts to identify the email accounts of current and former United States government officials  journalists covering political campaigns and accounts associated with a presidential campaign.

Though the company would not identify the presidential campaign involved  two people with knowledge of the hacking  who were not allowed to discuss it publicly  said it was President Trump’s.

In addition to Iran  hackers from Russia and North Korea have started targeting organizations that work closely with presidential candidates  according to security researchers and intelligence officials.

“We’ve already seen attacks on several campaigns and believe the volume and intensity of these attacks will only increase as the election cycle advances toward Election Day ” said Oren Falkowitz  the chief executive of the cybersecurity company Area 1  in an interview.

Microsoft’s report is the latest indication that cyberattacks and influence campaigns against political candidates are likely to accelerate heading into 2020. In 2016  Russian hackers infiltrated the computer networks of Democrats and Republicans  then selectively disseminated Democrats’ emails  including those of John D. Podesta  Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman  in an effort to harm Mrs. Clinton’s campaign.

Microsoft said the attacks occurred over a 30-day period in August and September. That was roughly after the Trump administration announced additional sanctions against Iran  more than a year following the president’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran. Iranian officials concede that the sanctions  intended to chock off the country’s oil revenue  have plunged the economy into a recession.

More recently  the administration has considered a cyberstrike to punish Tehran for what officials charge was an Iranian attack on Saudi oil facilities last month. It is all part of a low-level  daily cyberconflict between the two countries.

Iranian hackers have been engaged in a broad campaign against United States targets  according to Microsoft. The company found that hackers had tried to attack 241 accounts  using fairly unsophisticated means. The hackers appeared to have used information available about their victims online to discover their passwords. It was unclear what information they had stolen.

While the Microsoft report did not name Iran’s targets  it found evidence that hackers had infiltrated email inboxes in at least four cases. But the four successful hacks did not belong to a presidential campaign.

Tim Murtaugh  the Trump campaign’s communications director  said in a statement that “we have no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted.” Representatives for other presidential candidates said on Friday that their campaigns had not been targeted.

For weeks  officials from the F.B.I.  the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency have said they are particularly concerned about Iranian-backed attacks. Their worries stemmed from rising tensions over new sanctions on Iran and nascent Iranian activity in the 2018 midterm elections.

While the officials said they believed that all the presidential campaigns were likely targets  Mr. Trump’s has long been considered a prime one.

It was Mr. Trump who abandoned the nuclear deal and ramped up sanctions. The United States has also designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist group. The guard corps oversees the nuclear program and  by some accounts  Iran’s best hacking group  its Cyber Corps.

But it is not clear whether the group that Microsoft identified reports to the Cyber Corps or is made up  deliberately  of freelancers and others whose affiliations are harder to trace.

When Iranian officials are asked about cyberattacks  they admit nothing but note that attacks have been two-way. Three times in the past decade  the United States has directed cyberweapons against Iranian targets. The most famous attack  code-named Olympic Games  wiped out about 1 000 centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear enrichment site.

In recent weeks  United States Cyber Command was asked to develop options for retaliating against the missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil fields. Officials reported that a cyberstrike against Iran was emerging as the most attractive option  in an effort to avoid the kind of escalation that might result from a more conventional strike.

So far  there is no evidence of such action  but it might take a while to gain access to Iranian computer networks  and the results might be subtle.

Security executives at the Democratic National Committee warned staff members in an email this week that Iranian hackers might be targeting their email accounts with so-called spearphishing attacks  in which hackers try to lure their target into clicking on a malicious link or attachment. That link or attachment can give attackers a foothold into a computer network.

The hackers were also believed to be interfering with an additional security feature known as two-factor authentication — a common security method that asks for credentials beyond a password — and were creating fake LinkedIn personas to make their email lures more believable.

After Russia’s interference in 2016  Democrats have repeatedly warned their Republican counterparts that election interference cuts both ways  and that state-sponsored hackers may not always seek to help the Republican candidate.

But to date  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  the majority leader  has refused to bring any election security bills to the floor. And Mr. Trump has yet to acknowledge Russian interference in the 2016 election  even as cybersecurity experts collect evidence that Russian hacking of organizations close to the 2020 campaigns is again underway.

James A. Lewis  a former government official and cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington  said in a recent interview that cyberinterference  even from Russia  might not necessarily benefit Mr. Trump in 2020.

“The Russians have come to the conclusion that  so long as President Trump is in office  U.S.-Russian relations will remain at a standstill ” Mr. Lewis said.

Cybersecurity experts that specialize in disinformation say they have witnessed several coordinated disinformation campaigns aimed at influencing the 2020 campaign.

The bulk of that disinformation has originated domestically  said Cindy Otis  the director of analysis at Nisos  a cybersecurity firm in Alexandria  Va. She said other nation-states were closely watching these domestic operations but appeared to be holding back.

“We’ve seen a lot of disinformation on the domestic front  but nation-states are likely to amplify those narratives  as we saw Russia do in 2016 ” Ms. Otis said. “But with so many candidates still in the running  nation-states seem to be waiting before they put all their efforts into one basket.”

Some cybersecurity firms said they were also witnessing what appeared to be the beginning stages of several different nation-state cyberattacks on American political campaigns.

In July  Tom Burt  Microsoft’s corporate vice president  told an audience at the Aspen Security Conference that Microsoft had evidence that Russia  Iran and North Korea had been the most active nations conducting cyberattacks.

With funding tight  only a handful of Democratic presidential campaigns have invested in a full-time cybersecurity officer. Instead  they have relied on advice from the Democratic National Committee and DigiDems  a Democratic technology firm founded after the 2016 presidential campaign.

The Democratic National Committee’s chief security officer  Bob Lord  holds occasional video conferences with members of presidential campaign staffs to keep them abreast of the latest threats. The committee has also mandated that each campaign have a point of contact for cybersecurity  and sends out both regular and emergency newsletters.

Every campaign  no matter how many millions of dollars it has raised  faces a difficult decision when building out a cybersecurity team: Such technology and expertise is expensive  but so is an expansive ground game.

“Campaigns only last until Election Day or when your candidate drops out ” said Tad Devine  a former senior adviser to the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign. “If you spend too much on cybersecurity and not enough on voter contact  you’ll end your campaign by not making enough voter contact. So that’s the conundrum that campaigns are in.”

“Politics is a risk business ” Mr. Devine said. “You have to decide what risk you’re going to take.”

4;Los Angeles Tap Water Contains 18% Xanax and 7% OxyCodone;Viral Cords;"In new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) findings  they determined that average Los Angeles tap water contains 18% Xanax and 7% oxycodone.

Xanax  the anxiety medication  and oxycodone  the pain relief pill  were found in the highest rates around Brentwood  West Hollywood  and Beverly Hills.

We spoke to a scientist to help explain this phenomenon. Eric Bundy of Hollywood Hospital said  “People dispose of these medications down the drain and since e are in a drought  much of our water is recycled and cleaned. However  many of these chemicals remain in the water after the filtration process.”

Angelinos were not shocked by the findings but did elaborate on the EPA’s findings. Local LA resident Paul White told the LA Times  “The 80s were more fun when the tap water was mostly speed. It was all uppers all the time  it was great. Now it’s all downers and it’s not as much fun in my opinion.”

Others enjoyed the water. “I’m glad to drink eight glasses a day. I don’t know who’s dumping their drugs down the drain but keep up the great work ” said Nathaniel Roberts.

5;House Democrats subpoena White House for Ukraine documents  escalating impeachment probe;Jeremy Herb CNN;"(CNN)House Democrats on Friday issued a subpoena to the White House for documents related to Ukraine  ratcheting up the Democratic impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.

The subpoena came after the three committees leading the impeachment inquiry separately sent a letter Friday seeking documents from Vice President Mike Pence as part of their investigation into Trump and his conversation with the President of Ukraine.
The subpoena from House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings to the White House includes a request for a host of documents and communications tied to the President's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  the holding up of foreign aid to Ukraine and efforts by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates to push the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and Burisma  the company that hired Hunter Biden's son Hunter Biden to be on its board  according to a memo Cummings sent on the subpoena earlier this week.
""We deeply regret that President Trump has put us — and the nation — in this position  but his actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena "" Cummings of Maryland  House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California and House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel of New York wrote in a letter to the White House on Friday.
The subpoena escalates the Democratic impeachment investigation  which stems from the whistleblower complaint alleging Trump sought help from Ukraine's government to dig up dirt on his political rival and the White House sought to cover it up. The three panels leading the probe have already issued subpoenas to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Giuliani  in addition to Friday's White House subpoena.
The White House downplayed the subpoena.
""This subpoena changes nothing -- just more document requests  wasted time  and taxpayer dollars that will ultimately show the President did nothing wrong "" press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. ""The Do Nothing Democrats can continue with their kangaroo court while the President and his Administration will continue to work on behalf of the American people.""
The request for documents to Pence  meanwhile  adds the vice president to a growing list of Trump officials and allies from who Democrats are seeking documents as part of the impeachment inquiry.
The three chairmen leading the probe wrote a letter to Pence on Friday requesting the documents by October 15. A subpoena could also be looming for Pence if he does not voluntarily provide the documents.
Rather than traveling to Warsaw  Poland  last month to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  Trump decided to stay home to track the damage from Hurricane Dorian. In his place he sent Pence  whose face-to-face meeting with Zelensky now puts him at the heart of events that led to the impeachment inquiry by the House of Representatives.
The Democratic impeachment investigation stems from the whistleblower complaint alleging Trump sought help from Ukraine's government to dig up dirt on his political rival and the White House tried to cover it up.
House Democrats have set an aggressive schedule of depositions to go along with their document requests as they have prepared to potentially file articles of impeachment related to Ukraine  putting the other matters they were investigating involving the President -- from Russian election interference to the Emoluments clause of the Constitution -- to the side.
The vice president's spokesman said that the Democrats letter ""does not appear to be a serious request.""
""Given the scope  it does not appear to be a serious request but just another attempt by the Do Nothing Democrats to call attention to their partisan impeachment "" Pence spokeswoman Katie Waldman said in a statement. ""Despite their efforts to distract and obstruct our agenda  this Administration will stay focused on creating jobs  securing the border  rebuilding our military  negotiating better trade deals  and the issues most important to the American people.""
The Trump administration has signaled it does not intend to cooperate with the House investigation on Ukraine  just as it has stonewalled previous requests related to allegations of obstruction of justice and efforts to obtain the President's tax returns and other financial documents. Pompeo wrote in a letter this week that he would try to block State Department officials from testifying  calling the schedule unfeasible  and it was unclear whether he would comply with a subpoena that had a Friday deadline.
Trump said Friday that he would be issuing a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in response to the Democrats' request for documents. White House lawyers were drafting the letter saying they could not be compelled to produce documents until the full House votes to open an impeachment inquiry  something Pelosi has said is unnecessary according House rules.
Previously  Democrats have responded to White House stonewalling with contempt votes and lawsuits to pry loose the materials they were seeking. But they now appear to be taking a different tack with the Ukraine inquiry: arguing that a failure to cooperate will make their case that obstruction of justice occurred.
""We don't want this to drag on months and months and months  which appears to be the Administration's strategy  so they just need to know that even as they try to undermine our ability to find the facts around the President's effort to coerce a foreign leader to create dirt that he can use against the political opponent  that they will be strengthening the case on obstruction if they behave that way "" Schiff said at a newsconference this week.
But the Democrats have had successes in obtaining information  too  including the testimony from former US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and text messages Volker provided showing that Trump's push for an investigation was linked to Ukraine's efforts to obtain a face-to-face meeting between the two presidents.
Pence was told about the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky a day after it occurred  sources told CNN  although they would not say whether the vice president was briefed about what Trump said about the Bidens.

6;BREAKING: Donald Trump Secretly Hired Illegal Immigrants To Start Building Border Wall;BOB THE EMPIRE NEWS POTATO;"Top secret documents leaked to the press by a White House staffer showed that President Trump ordered the hiring of over 2 000 illegal immigrants to begin working on his border wall between Texas and Mexico.

7;Trump Tells Fox News ‘Dishonest Media’ Stole His Wallet During Florida Campaign Rally;R. HOBBUS J.D.;"WASHINGTON  D.C. – President Donald J. Trump  in an appearance on Fox News this week  accused a CNN news crew of stealing his wallet during his 2020 presidential campaign rally in Florida last Saturday. “Let me tell you  these people are very dishonest ” the President told Shepard Smith on Tuesday. “They came to me asking for a soundbite and the next thing – the next thing you know  my wallet is gone.”

President Trump described the wallet as a brown leather passcase from his own Signature Collection and said at the time of the theft he was carrying it in the right pocket of his sports coat. “These people have their own agenda; they can’t be trusted. You look at CNN and the fake stories they put out  it’s sick what these people will do for ratings ” Trump charged before adding that the Secret Service is spearheading an investigation into the incident.

While refusing to elaborate on the nature of the investigation  President Trump told Fox News he has ordered Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy to personally lead the inquiry into his wallet’s whereabouts. “Believe me  this is very  very serious and we’re going to get to the bottom of it ” Trump vowed. “You’re going to start hearing things very soon.” The President went on to say that at the time of the alleged theft  the contents of his wallet included a billfold of approximately five thousand dollars in hundred-dollar bills and a copy of the nuclear launch codes.

Sources close to President Trump say he rarely ventures out without his Donald J. Trump Signature Collection passcase wallet. Designed for the discerning entrepreneur  the leather wallet features an emboldened gold logo and comes equipped with a bill compartment  three credit card pockets  and ample storage space. A presidential profile piece published by The New York Times on Wednesday provided a brief description of the high-end wallet  saying it contained “a pocket-sized photograph of Russian president Vladimir Putin and no cash.”

8;Saudi restores oil output after attacks  focused on IPO: Minister;Hamad I Mohammed;"Saudi Arabia has fully restored oil output after attacks on its facilities last month and is now focused on the listing of Saudi Aramco  its energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said.

The kingdom's oil production capacity now stands at 11.3 million barrels per day  he told an energy conference in Russia on Thursday  adding: ""We all rose to the challenge.""

""We have stabilised production capacity  we are at 11.3 ... we still have the kit and the tools to overcome any future challenges...""

The comments follow attacks on two major oil production facilities on September 14 that knocked out more than half the production of the world's top oil-exporting nation  prompting concerns over the global supply of oil as well as the company's prospects ahead of a highly-anticipated initial public offering (IPO).

The listing of Aramco is the centrepiece of Saudi Arabia's plans to shake up its economy and diversify away from oil.

Sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters news agency that Aramco is courting sovereign wealth funds in Abu Dhabi and Singapore  among other territories  in order to achieve a $2 trillion valuation in the domestic leg of its listing.

10;Black giraffe was ‘acting suspiciously’  claims Breitbart;Arabin Patson;"As a female trophy hunter drew the ire of the Internet by shooting a rare black giraffe and boasting about it on social media  right-wing news website Breitbart.com leapt to her defence and insisted that the victim was being aggressive and left the woman with no choice but to shoot.

The website’s front page claimed that sources on the Serengeti reported the giraffe had previous involvement with the deadly gang-related feud between herbivores and carnivores.

It also stated that the creature had been sighted that day taking acacia leaves without permission from the park rangers.

Breitbart columnist Jayce Morgan also used his popular Youtube channel  TriggerTheCucks  to claim the giraffe was complicit in its own death.

He told his viewers  “Of course the SJWs and the liberal media will say it was an unjustified shooting. They are safe at home  but on the savanna hindsight is a luxury.

“Tess had to make a split second decision to save her life. The giraffe weighs nearly a ton and is three-times her height. Why didn’t he comply with her perfectly reasonable demand to place his head on her living room wall?

“And now the wildlife baiting industry is going to come in and claim prejudice. Anything to avoid taking responsibility for their actions.

The exchange would issue shares as part of the transaction and Refinitiv holders may receive a stake of approximately 37%  LSE said early Saturday in London in a statement.

London Stock Exchange Group Plc Hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s David Schwimmer As Chief Executive Officer
David SchwimmerSource: London Stock Exchange Group Plc
The effort is the first major strategic move by LSE Chief Executive Officer David Schwimmer  who joined the 218-year-old exchange from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last August and has been riding a 40% surge in the stock price this year. The company has seen the most growth in the last few years from its information services unit  driven by the FTSE Russell Indexes business  and adding a data goliath would aim to help accelerate that push.

It would also be a quick flip for the Blackstone Group Inc.-led consortium that bought a majority stake in Refinitiv from Thomson Reuters Corp. last year. The company has been active ever since  as its Tradeweb Markets LLC bond-trading platform went public in April  and Deutsche Boerse AG’s chief executive officer said this week that his firm is still in talks to buy some of Refinitiv’s foreign-exchange business units.

Time Frame
News of the talks had filtered out on Friday. A deal could be announced as soon as next week  according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. No final agreement has been reached and the talks could still fall apart  the people said.

A formal agreement for the deal could be announced Aug. 1  when LSE publishes half-year earnings  according to two of the people.

A representative for Blackstone declined to comment earlier.

Thomson Reuters said in a statement it expects to hold about a 15% stake in LSE if the transaction is completed. The 30-year Reuters News agreement signed with Refinitiv in 2018 will continue if ownership of Refinitiv changes  according to the statement.

Blackstone  Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and GIC  Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund  acquired 55% of Refinitiv -- as the former financial and risk unit of Thomson Reuters was renamed -- in a transaction last year that valued the business at $20 billion.

Thomson Reuters  which still has a 45% stake in Refinitiv  rose 4.3% after the Financial Times reported talks between LSE and Refinitiv earlier Friday.

LSE has previously sought to bulk up by merging with Deutsche Boerse  a deal that would’ve vaulted the combined firm into the ranks of the biggest global exchange firms  along with CME Group Inc. and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. But that combination was blocked by regulatory hurdles  and Schwimmer ruled out big exchange mergers after taking the job.

“The LSE is clearly pursuing deals that are more vertical than horizontal  presumably after seeing competition difficulties issues arise when some deals with other exchanges are mooted ” said Niki Beattie  founder of consultancy Market Structure Partners in London.

12;Canadian Billionaire Thomson to Buy 15% Stake in Argentine Digital Bank;Jorgelina Do Rosario;"Canadian billionaire David Thomson is backing a digital venture in South America’s second-largest economy.

Thomson will buy a 15% stake in Argentine digital bank Brubank  founded by former Citigroup Inc executive Juan Bruchou  according to a statement by the company. Brubank  a lender with no branches  has 40 000 customers after seven months in operation without advertising beyond word of mouth. The value of the deal was not disclosed  and is pending approval by Argentina’s central bank. The company looks to use the funds from the deal to grow in Argentina  and is analyzing expanding to Mexico  Colombia or Peru  Bruchou said.

The move comes amid double-digit inflation and a slow economic recovery from a recession after a currency crisis in 2018. Foreign direct investment has dropped amid investor jitters as the country heads into a presidential election in October. The payments sector is one of the few in Argentina that has seen deals this year  including a $750 million investment by Advent International in the local operator of Visa Inc  and a stake purchase by China’s Tencent of payments app Uala.

13;Study Shows Teen Pregnancy Drops Significantly After Age 19;Jane M. Agni;"A new study reveals teen pregnancy rates drop significantly after age 19.

The startling correlation was reported by millions of family planning centers nationwide after a 5 years study conducted by an exclusive research team led by Dr. Sandra McKinnon.

Dr. Sandra McKinnon reported the team’s findings during a recent US Reproductive Studies Symposium. “It is an undisputed fact that teen pregnancy rates are nearly non-existent when a woman reaches the age of 20. If you encourage your adolescents to abstain from sexual intercourse until they reach this age  the chances of them becoming teen mothers are incredibly slim–Almost nonexistent.

“While the parents are concerned with protecting their young daughters from badly-timed pregnancies  we’re concerned with finding the correlation between the age of 20  and it’s effect on teen pregnancy.”

Dr. McKinnons findings were hailed as “groundbreaking and revolutionary” by senior researchers who have been attempting to find ways to reduce teen pregnancy rates for 30 years.

“I have faith that this new information will really change the face of reproductive education.” Said Dr. Benjamin Harbo  President of the US Reproductive Studies Symposium. “I think these studies will empower young women to avoid early motherhood so that they can develop their lives and careers prior to making the choice to get pregnant.”

14;House Democrats subpoena White House for documents in Trump impeachment probe;Steve Holland and Patricia Zengerle;"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Democrats on Friday subpoenaed the White House for documents they want to see as part of their impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump.


The chairmen of three House of Representatives committees said they want documents related to a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that is at the heart of their inquiry.

The three said they were forced to issue the subpoena after the White House failed to produce documents they requested in a Sept. 9 letter.

“We deeply regret that President Trump has put us - and the nation - in this position  but his actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena ” said Representatives Elijah Cummings of the Oversight Committee  Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee and Eliot Engel of the Foreign Affairs Committee.

They gave the White House until Oct. 18 to produce the information  including who else besides Trump was on the phone call with Zelenskiy.

“This subpoena changes nothing - just more document requests  wasted time  and taxpayer dollars that will ultimately show the President did nothing wrong ” White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.

White House lawyers believe Trump  a Republican  can ignore lawmakers’ demands until the Democratic-controlled House holds a full vote of the chamber to formally approve of the impeachment inquiry  according to a person familiar with the matter.

Earlier  the committees asked Vice President Mike Pence to hand over documents relating to a meeting he held with Zelenskiy and the call between Zelenskiy and Trump.

They gave Pence until Oct. 15 to produce any records relating to the July call and a meeting he held with Zelenskiy on Sept. 1.

According to a partial transcript of the call  Trump asked Zelenskiy the “favor” of investigating former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden  a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020  and his son  Hunter Biden  who had served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma.

At the time  the Trump administration was withholding hundreds of millions in aid for Ukraine and Democrats said they suspect Trump was using U.S. foreign policy and taxpayer money for his personal political gain. Trump is running for re-election.

“Recently  public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president’s stark message to the Ukrainian president ” Cummings  Schiff and Engel wrote in a letter to Pence.

A spokeswoman for Pence said the broad nature of the request showed that it was not “serious.”

When Pence met with Zelenskiy  the two discussed the $250 million in security assistance that the U.S. Congress had approved but that the Trump administration had not disbursed.

WHISTLEBLOWER
The contents of the Trump-Zelenskiy call were revealed by a member of the intelligence community who filed a whistleblower complaint and remains anonymous. Trump has said he wants to know the whistleblower’s identity.

Democratic Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi  a member of the Intelligence Committee  said he believed the whistleblower’s identity should be kept secret even from members of the panel.

“I think that the less we know about that person  the more protected he or she will be ” Krishnamoorthi told Reuters.

A second intelligence official  who has more direct information about Trump’s dealings with Ukraine than the first whistleblower  is also considering filing a whistleblower complaint  the New York Times reported  citing two people briefed on the matter.

The second official is among those interviewed by the intelligence community inspector general to corroborate the allegations of the original whistleblower  one of the people said  according to the Times.

The inspector general  Michael Atkinson  testified before a closed-door session of the House Intelligence Committee on Friday.

The investigation could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the U.S. Senate. Republicans who control the Senate have shown little appetite for ousting Trump.

A cache of diplomatic texts Democrats received as part of their impeachment inquiry showed U.S. officials pressured the Ukrainian government to launch investigations that might benefit Trump’s personal political agenda in exchange for a meeting of the two countries’ leaders.

Kurt Volker  who resigned last week as Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine  gave the messages to the House committees in a closed-door meeting on Thursday  and the chairmen released them later in the day.

ROMNEY PUSHES BACK
Trump has said Biden and his son are “corrupt” but has shown no evidence to back that up. The president on Thursday went a step further in his attacks on Biden when he called on China to investigate the former vice president and his son  who had business interests there.

U.S. senator and former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said on Friday it was “wrong and appalling” for Trump to push other nations to investigate Biden.

“When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China’s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process  it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated ” Romney said on Twitter.

Trump said on Friday he would not tie a much-anticipated trade deal with China to his desire for Beijing to investigate Joe Biden.

“One thing has nothing to do with the other ” he said.

Biden leads in most opinion polls among the 19 Democrats seeking the party’s nomination. His campaign has blasted Trump’s efforts as desperate.

In a signal of how Kiev will handle investigations being watched in Washington  Ukrainian prosecutors said they would review 15 old probes related to Burisma’s founder but added that they were unaware of any evidence of wrongdoing by Biden’s son.

The White House plans to argue that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  a Democrat  must have the full House vote to formally approve an impeachment inquiry  a source familiar with the effort said.

Without a vote  White House lawyers believe Trump  who has called the impeachment probe a “hoax ” can ignore lawmakers’ requests  the source said  meaning the federal courts would presumably have to render a decision and potentially slow the march toward impeachment.

California citizens voted in 1996 to legalize the use of medicinal marijuana. This movement helped lead the growth of other states reforming their policy towards a weed that grows in the ground. California has kept medical records since 1996 and now the United States Attorney General  Jeff Sessions  wants the states complete list.

“We are just looking for criminals  not you ” said Sessions. “We are going to be tough on crime not related to me or any of my friends and family.”

California tells Sessions  “He can’t have it.” Critics worry that the list will be used to target its citizens.

California filed an injunction with federal judges to help sort out the information with allowing the lawyers to sort through the constitution and the Patients Rights Act of 1976. “First  medical records are private and you need a warrant from a judge to access that information ” said Cheech Hernandez. “Those are our rights  mang.”

16;Bernie Sanders Had Heart Attack  His Doctors Say as He Leaves Hospital;Sydney Ember;"Senator Bernie Sanders had a heart attack this week  his presidential campaign said on Friday as he left a Las Vegas hospital  following three days of near silence from the candidate and his advisers about his health.

Mr. Sanders  78  had entered the hospital on Tuesday night after experiencing chest pain at a campaign event  and doctors had inserted two stents in a blocked artery  a relatively common procedure. But the campaign did not confirm that Mr. Sanders had had a heart attack until Friday  inviting questions about his condition  and his campaign’s transparency  as he remained off the campaign trail this week.

Television cameras filmed Mr. Sanders as he left the hospital Friday  waving to onlookers and pumping a fist  then driving off in a sport utility vehicle. He will remain in Las Vegas on Friday night and return to his home in Burlington  Vt.  on Saturday  campaign officials said.

“After two and a half days in the hospital  I feel great  and after taking a short time off  I look forward to getting back to work ” Mr. Sanders said in a statement.

While much of the conversation in the Democratic race has centered on issues like health care and student debt  Mr. Sanders’s heart attack is likely to heighten scrutiny on age in a primary where the top candidates are all in their 70s. In addition to Mr. Sanders  former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is 76 and Senator Elizabeth Warren is 70. President Trump is 73.

But if Mr. Sanders has  until this week  largely avoided questions about his health — he has projected an image of fitness as a candidate and has maintained a blistering schedule on the campaign trail — the spotlight is now squarely on him. The ages of the current leaders notwithstanding  many Democratic voters have expressed discomfort with nominating a septuagenarian candidate  a notion that some political strategists say Mr. Sanders’s heart attack is unlikely to dispel.

“Running for president is a physical and emotional trial  and the presidency itself is even more demanding ” said David Axelrod  a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. “While we all wish Senator Sanders well  this has to be a big flashing light for him. And given his age  it may be for some voters  as well.”

Mr. Sanders began experiencing chest discomfort on Tuesday evening during a grass-roots fund-raiser he was hosting at a Las Vegas restaurant. As he began taking questions from the audience  he asked a campaign aide for a chair. He did not stay much longer at the event  and became visibly uncomfortable in a car afterward  according to two campaign officials  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic.

At that point  Mr. Sanders was taken to an urgent care facility  where doctors determined that he should be transferred to a hospital. He was then taken by ambulance to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center.

At the hospital  he was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory  where doctors inserted two stents into a blocked artery. By Wednesday  he was talking to his campaign manager  Faiz Shakir  about the campaign. By Thursday  he was walking laps around the hospital hallway  the officials said.

His doctors in Las Vegas  Arturo E. Marchand Jr. and Arjun Gururaj  said in a statement that Mr. Sanders’s “hospital course was uneventful with good expected progress.” He spent three nights at the hospital and canceled his events and appearances for the week.

The campaign released little information during the week about the extent of Mr. Sanders’s heart trouble  fueling speculation about his health. But on Thursday the campaign said he would participate in the next Democratic debate  to be held near Columbus  Ohio  on Oct. 15.

A heart attack means that a portion of the heart muscle died  starved of blood when a vessel was blocked  Dr. Gilbert Tang  a heart surgeon at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York  said.

“The first question is  how serious was the heart attack? What muscle was damaged and how will that affect the heart’s function?” Dr. Tang said. “If it was a significant portion of the heart  will that affect the heart’s ability to pump?”

If only a small portion of heart muscle was damaged  he added  Mr. Sanders should make a full recovery — even at 78. These days recovery does not depend on age so much as other medical issues  like lung problems  he said.

That does not mean that Mr. Sanders can simply continue as if nothing happened  though. Doctors usually recommend a cardiac rehabilitation program  which is essentially an exercise program in which patients are closely monitored. Such a program  Dr. Tang said  “conditions the heart to work harder.”

Mr. Sanders will also take a cocktail of drugs to reduce his risk of another heart attack  including powerful anti-clotting medications that require close monitoring for a month.

ON POLITICSMake sense of the people  issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.
In the 2016 presidential campaign  Mr. Sanders’s doctor said that the senator was “in overall very good health.” His ailments included gout; a mild elevation of cholesterol; an inflammation of out-pouches in the bowel known as diverticulitis; and hormone replacement therapy for an underactive thyroid gland. He had no reported history of heart disease.

Among the other candidates  Mr. Biden underwent emergency surgery in 1988 for a near-fatal ruptured berry aneurysm of an artery in his brain. He also underwent surgery to remove a second berry aneurysm. In 2008  Mr. Biden’s doctor said that he had recovered fully.

Mr. Trump has not had a medical emergency while running for or serving in office  though he has not released as much medical information to the public as other recent presidents have. This year  the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in “very good health ” although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.

Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble  though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s third term and until his death in his fourth term  his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term  and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president.

In 1999  former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation  a heart rhythm abnormality  before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him.

Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail  Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren  and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip.

Hoping to reverse course  he had recently begun to focus more on his electability  arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election.

The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter  placing him ahead of Ms. Warren  his chief ideological rival  by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising.

In a show of force  the campaign announced a $1.3 million ad buy in Iowa that it then postponed as it waited to assess the situation; the ad will now begin airing next Tuesday  and will run for two weeks as planned.

Campaign officials said they would determine when he would return to the trail as he recovers at his home  and it was possible that his first public appearance would be at the debate. His demeanor then will likely be watched closely by both voters and the news media.

Already  Mr. Sanders is working against a built-in bias. When asked about age  voters show a clear preference for younger presidential candidates  with an overwhelming majority saying they prefer candidates in their 40s through 60s  according to surveys. When asked about the ideal age for a president  just 3 percent said the 70s  according to polling released by Pew Research Center in May. Other polls have shown that Americans express more discomfort with a candidate in his or her 70s than one who is gay  Muslim or an independent.

Bryce Smith  27  the Democratic Party chair in Dallas County  Iowa  said Mr. Sanders’s health scare could hurt his chances — particularly against Ms. Warren.

“I do see that as something that is going to deter people that were maybe on the fence ” he said. “If anyone was teetering between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders  this probably showed them that Elizabeth Warren has the stamina and the health and is a little bit younger in age to see it through eight years.”

Jill Alper  a Democratic strategist in Michigan and a veteran of Bill Clinton’s and John Kerry’s presidential bids  said voters would be watching Mr. Sanders closely in the next debate.

“Does his energy level change? Does he campaign differently?” she said. “If he maintains a reasonable energy level  it may not change anything for him.”

On Friday evening  after Mr. Sanders was released from the hospital  he dropped off his bags at his hotel and went for a walk in a park with his wife  Jane Sanders.

17;Former Pharmacutical Exec Martin Shkreli Buys Controlling Stake in Twitter;R. HOBBUS J.D.;"NEW YORK  Ny. – Former U.S. drug executive Martin Shkreli  who was suspended from Twitter on Sunday for harassing a female journalist  has purchased a controlling stake in the social media service for an estimated $7.1 billion with the intent of reinstating his account.

“As the company’s majority shareholder  Martin will have the final say on all matters pertaining to Twitter and its many subsidiaries ” explained Jack Dorsey  Twitter’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer. Dorsey said the thirty-four year-old Shkreli  who served as CEO for Turing Pharmaceuticals in 2015  aims to reinvent the social media platform in his own image.

During an appearance on CNN Monday morning  Shkreli announced that his first order of business will be to replace Twitter’s signature bird logo with a likeness of himself. “When people think Twitter  they’re going to think Martin Shkreli ” Mr. Shkreli told New Day co-host Alisyn Camerota. “History will know me as the Martin Luther King  Jr. of social media ” he ardently declared  later adding that he has already updated his Wikipedia page to reflect that statement.

Hours after Twitter officials moved to suspend Mr. Shkreli’s account over his alleged cyber-harassment of Teen Vogue editor Lauren Duca  thousands of supporters stormed the company’s office in New York City – ransacking the building and making off with thousands of dollars worth of office supplies – in an effort to protest the decision. “Martin Shkreli is the lone voice of reason in these trying times ” said one supporter who asked to remain anonymous because she had just set fire to a corporate vehicle.

18;Trump re-election campaign targeted by Iran-linked hackers: sources;"
Christopher Bing and Raphael Satter";"(Reuters) - A hacking group that appears to be linked to the Iranian government attempted to break into U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign but were unsuccessful  sources familiar with the operation told Reuters on Friday.


Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said earlier on Friday in a blog post bit.ly/2ngs5bZ that it saw ""significant"" cyber activity by the group which also targeted current and former U.S. government officials  journalists covering global politics and prominent Iranians living outside Iran.

Trump’s official campaign website is the only one of the remaining major contenders’ sites that is linked to Microsoft’s cloud email service  according to an inspection of publicly available mail exchanger records.

“We have no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted ” said Trump campaign Director of Communications Tim Murtaugh.

In a 30-day period between August and September  the group  dubbed “Phosphorous” by Microsoft  made more than 2 700 attempts to identify consumer email accounts belonging to specific customers and then attacked 241 of those accounts.

“Four accounts were compromised as a result of these attempts; these four accounts were not associated with the U.S. presidential campaign or current and former U.S. government officials ” the blog post said.

Nineteen Democrats are seeking their party’s nomination to run for president in the November 2020 election. Three Republicans have announced their candidacy to challenge Trump in the party’s nominating contest.

Microsoft’s blog post did not identify the election campaign whose network was targeted by Phosphorous hackers  but sources told Reuters the target was Trump’s re-election effort.

The FBI did declined to comment.

Chris Krebs  director of the Homeland Security Department’s election security division  known as CISA  said he was aware of the Microsoft report. In a statement  Krebs called it “yet more evidence that our adversaries are looking to undermine our democratic institutions.”

Hacking to interfere in elections has become a concern for governments  especially since U.S intelligence agencies concluded that Russia ran a hacking and propaganda operation to disrupt the American democratic process in 2016 to help then-candidate Trump become president. Moscow has denied any meddling.

Tensions between the United States and Iran have risen since May 2018  when Trump withdrew from a 2015 international nuclear accord with Tehran that put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for easing of sanctions. Trump has since reinstated U.S. sanctions  increasing pressure on the Iranian economy  including its oil trade.

The Iranian government did not issue any immediate comment through state-run media on Microsoft’s statement.

John Hultquist  director of intelligence at cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc  said the particular Iranian group named in the attempts had been conducting “high-volume operations” aimed at harvesting credentials for online accounts.

Phosphorus is also known by APT 35  Charming Kitten  and Ajax Security Team.

Redmond  Washington-based Microsoft said Phosphorous used information gathered from researching their targets or other means to game password reset or account recovery features and attempt to take over some targeted accounts.

The attacks were not technically sophisticated  Microsoft said.

“This effort suggests Phosphorous is highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering ” the blog said.

Federal Election Commission records show that the Trump campaign has spent tens of thousands of dollars on Microsoft products and software.

A computer network used by 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign here was hacked in a cyberattack on Democratic Party political organizations.

Big tech companies are under pressure to ramp up security for next year’s U.S. elections and others around the world.

Companies including Facebook Inc (FB.O)  Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O)  Microsoft and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) met with U.S. intelligence agencies earlier in September to discuss security strategies.

19;Explosive devices' sent to Clinton  Obama  CNN;Kevin Coombs;"At least five suspicious packages were sent to top Democrats  including former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  and CNN's New York offices  authorities said on Wednesday.

All the packages were intercepted  and there were no reports of injuries.  

US Secret Service said it recovered a single package addressed to Clinton in Westchester  a suburb north of Manhattan late on Tuesday.

A second package  addressed to Obama  was found early on Wednesday in Washington  DC.

""The packages were immediately identified during routine mail screening procedures as potential explosive devices and were appropriately handled as such "" the Secret Service said in a statement.

""The protectees did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them "" it said.

Secret Service launched an investigation to find the source of the packages. 

Hillary Clinton was not at her New York home when Tuesday's package was sent  but her husband  former President Bill Clinton was present  officials told the Associated Press. While at a Florida fundraiser  she said ""we are fine"" and thanked US Secret Service for intercepting the package ""long before it made its way to our home"". 

CNN evacuated 
The New York Police Department (NYPD) also responded to a suspicious device  believed to be a pipe bomb  found at the Time Warner Center  where CNN's New York newsroom is based. 

Suspicious packages found in last week:
George Soros: Explosive device found in the mailbox outside the philanthropist's New York home on Monday. 

Hillary Clinton: Authorities intercepted suspicious device sent to Clinton's New York suburban home late on Tuesday. 

Barack Obama: Authorities intercepted suspicious device sent to Obama's Washington  DC home early on Wednesday. 

CNN New York office: Suspicious package  addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan  found in mailroom of the Time Warner Center  home to CNN's New York office on Wednesday.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz: Suspicious package found on Wednesday in the building where Florida Congresswoman Schultz's office is located. CNN reported that the package was meant for former US Attorney General Eric Holder. 

Maxine Waters: The US representative said in a statement that Capitol Police informed her that her Washington  DC office was a target of a suspicious package on Monday.

The New York City police commissioner said the package contained what appeared to be a live explosive and envelope containing white powder. 

The package was addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan  CNN reported  citing city and local law enforcement officials. Brennan appears on other cable and broadcast networks. 

According to the NYPD's chief of counterterrorism  the explosive appeared to be sent by the same person who mailed suspicious packages to the Clinton and Obama homes  as well as the device found on Monday at the home of billionaire philanthropist George Soros. 

FBI officials said at a news conference that the devices all appeared to be crude pipe bombs. 

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the attempted attacks were ""clearly an act of terrorism"".

CNN anchors were on the air from New York discussing the explosive devices addressed to Obama and Clinton when they were interrupted by a fire alarm and cut to a commercial. 

Here's the moment CNN had to handoff to DC and evacuate Time Warner Center in New York

The news organisation's New York staff evacuated the building as a precaution.   

CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker said there is a ""total and complete lack of understanding"" at the White House about the seriousness of the administration's attacks on the media. 

""The president  and especially the White House press secretary  should understand their words matter. Thus far  they have shown no comprehension of that "" he said. 

CNN has been a repeated targeted of Trump's attack on the media  with the US president often labelling the network as ""fake news"".

Police are also investigating a suspicious package sent to a building where the office of Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is located. The building was evacuated  but it remains unclear what the package contains  according to 7 News Miami. CNN reported that the package was addressed to former US Attorney General Eric Holder  but was sent to the wrong address and returned to Wasserman Schultz's office due to the return address on the package. 

Democratic Representative Maxine Waters said in a statement on Wednesday that US Capitol Police said that her Washington  DC  office was the target of a suspicious package that was referred to the FBI. It's unclear whether the package was related to those sent to Clinton  Obama and the CNN New York office. 

'These terrorising acts are despicable'
The White House condemned the attempted attacks  saying ""terrorising acts are despicable  and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law"".

Press Secretary Sarah Sanders added in a statement that the ""United States Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and will take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards"".

US President Donald Trump said that ""acts or threats of political violence have no place in the United States""  adding that a ""major federal investigation"" is under way. 

With the country deeply polarised under Trump  the packages brought a new level of tension to the upcoming midterm elections on November 6.

Democratic leaders said that Trump's call for unity after the packages were found ""rings hollow"" because of his past statements that condone acts of violence. 

""Time and time again  the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and his actions "" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives top Democrat Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.

They cited Trump's ""support for the congressman who body-slammed a reporter  the neo-Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville  his supporters at rallies who get violent with protesters  dictators around the world who murder their own citizens  and referring to the free press as the enemy of the people.""
